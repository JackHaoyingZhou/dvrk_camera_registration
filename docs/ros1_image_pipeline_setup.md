# Setting ROS1 Image pipeline 

The following document describes how to set up some required features from the [ROS1 image pipeline][1] needed to use the hand-eye calibration script. Three steps need to be performed: (1) calibrating cameras, (2) publishing calibration parameters in `camera_info` topic, and (3) undistort and republish frames.

## Step 1: print calibration checkerboard

Print checkerboard from here: <https://github.com/Cartucho/dvrk_calib_hand_eye/blob/main/camera_calibration.md>.  This pattern has the following features:
* Square size: 4.80mm -> 0.00480m
* Size: 22x17

Check the printer has not scaled the checkerboard by measuring the square size. Other patterns can be used but the `square_size` and the `size` are needed when calling the calibration scripts.

## Step 2: Camera calibration 
Camera calibration can be performed with any software that generates the standard 3x3 camera intrinsics and 1x5 distortion coefficients specified in OpenCV. Since the hand-eye calibration expects the parameters to be published in a standard ROS topic, it is recommended to use ROS utils to calibrate the cameras.

Monocular calibration (Single camera)
```bash
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 22x17 --square 0.0048 image:=/jhu_daVinci/left/decklink/jhu_daVinci_left/image_raw camera:=/jhu_daVinci/left/decklink/jhu_daVinci_left/ --no-service-check
```

Stereo calibration (Camera pair)
```bash
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --approximate 0.1 --size 22x17 --square 0.0048 right:=/jhu_daVinci/right/decklink/jhu_daVinci_right/image_raw left:=/jhu_daVinci/left/decklink/jhu_daVinci_left/image_raw right_camera:=/my_stereo/right left_camera:=/my_stereo/left --no-service-check
```

After running the calibration GUI make sure to save the calibration parameters. The application will create a compressed file with the pictures used for calibration and a `yaml` file with the actual parameters.

## Step 3 - Modify video launch files 

Modify the video launch file so that correct camera parameters are published in `camera_info` topic. To do this extract the .yaml file generated by the calibration script and add the location of this file to the video [pipeline launch file](../video_launch_files/jhu_daVinci_video.launch).

```xml
<arg name="camera_info_file" value="file:////home/jbarrag3/research_juan/hand_eye_collect/data_ros_calib/stereo_calib1/right.yaml"/>
```

Modify this file for both left and right cameras.

## Step 4: Rectify (undistorted) images 

Images can be rectified, i.e., undistorted with the `stereo_image_proc` function in the `image_pipeline`

```bash
ROS_NAMESPACE=/jhu_daVinci/decklink/ rosrun stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc
```

After running this script you should obtain an `image_rect_color` topic for your left and right cameras.

```
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/jhu_daVinci/decklink/left/image_rect_color
```

  <summary> Trouble shooting the image processor </summary>

The ROS image processing package expects the topics in a very specific format to process the pair of stereo images. If you are using a different launch file than the one provided in this repo check that the topics have the right format

```bash
rostopic list | grep image_raw$
```

This command should result in 
```bash
/jhu_daVinci/decklink/left/image_raw
/jhu_daVinci/decklink/right/image_raw
```
